MAJOR THINGS I WANT TO BE DONE

1. Categories for groups like groups.yahoo.com ADD TAGS to be furthur divided(subqueries I think)
2. Admin panel split into 2 user (change password, email, contact) and admin(manage requests, edit group properties)
3. View All Members(to contact if needed/know who they are)
4.Open group -> no admin, anyone can join, deleted when everyone leaves
closed group->super admin,choose super admins, remove poeple, and approval Any super admin can delete
Visibility->secret, 

super admin-> edit group,delete group and kick people out

5. User Profiles

6. trigger to delete group whene number of members=0

SEARCH -> VIBIL


add user profile links
remove all autocomplete
Change css style
Add views, aggregates and possibly triggers

BUGS NEED TO BE FIXED
when you use ' in title appears as \'
Activation serves no point now.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
POSSIBILITIES 
48 hours link.

Triggers somehow
Need DOB to validate stuff

TO BE IMPLEMENTED

Edit group 		- NOT DONE (admin can do this)
home page most recent updates/notifications - not implemented instead all groups
invite users
admin panel -> change password, check requests
block/reject users from joining group- add another column status
delete account
SEARCH POSTS!!! through a search bar.

BUGS

Remove all the comments from code
remove localhost -> replace with url

FEATURES TO BE ADDED
